### for science and the lulz

#### my notes

* we start at 18.00 CEST
* in the mean time some yummy src
  * docs https://docs.rapyd.net/build-with-rapyd/docs
  * api reference https://docs.rapyd.net/build-with-rapyd/reference/api-reference

* speaker is a "kyle pollock"
* introduction of some peeps, one product guy "Walt Cox", looks like he come from valley bank(?)
* rapyd is bascially a payment for risk products, like cannabis, which is not allowed to be traded, by master or visa e.g
* Walt is showing his dev-obs board for the sprints 

#### demoing for valley retail app

* stuff is written in c# ?
* showoff the walled ui for customer heartiCulture
* frontend is react based
* problem is that banks need up tp 50 fields of data filled
* they tried to condense the UI
* manager speech "it is not like this risky, because we can keep our account from the bank"
* the acutal bank behind this is [Valley bank](https://www.valley.com/)
* the users bankaccount is linked to the fund, so we would need to allow deposits from our users bank


#### QA
* the distinction betwen consumer and merchant
* merchant has types 
* customer can come from every county, but emails needs to ne older then 30 days
* q: about UPI gateway in india
* Walt likes UPI and considers the standardization and the auth problem
* RTP RealTimePayment protocol is well implemented by UPI
* so UPI is an early adapter on the implementation of RTP

> will you showcase more code for the developers here? i came for curiosity and to understand how i could use rapyd in a real product. Could i start out of the box on a product by using rapyd. Could rapyd be the payment solution for others webshops, that are not in high risk. As far as i understood all accounts on rapyd will be linked to valley bank, and they ensure the transaction. How is the communication for developer that have questions on implementation details, is there liike a rapyd discord. So many qstns

>Hey Jan, we can take this into another disucssion. Rapyd would like to talk in more detail with what your goals are and how we can potentially help. Is that okay with you?
